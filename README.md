# Chaos in Non-Linear Circuits

## Abstract

Implementation of non-linear circuits is an interesting way of solving the problem of non-linear differential equations. In this study, we will be investigating the chaotic behavior in non-linear circuits using the Lorenz attractor and the Jerk circuit. Using the numerical methods, we will solve the same equations and compare the results. We also study the emergence of chaos across a range of parameters using their bifurcation diagram.
