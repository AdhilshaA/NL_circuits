# Chaos in Non-Linear Circuits (report)

## Abstract

Implementations of non-linear circuits is an interesting venture into solving the problem of non-linear differential equations. In this study, we will be studying the chaotic behavior in non-linear circuits using the Lorentz attractor and the Jerk circuit. Using the numerical methods, we will solve the same equations and compare the results. We also study the emergence of chaos across a range of parameters and initial conditions.
